# Land-Potential
Land Potential Analysis Project

Description
The "Land Potential" project is a comprehensive analysis of land use, productivity, and potential across various regions. Utilizing advanced data visualization techniques through Tableau, this project aims to provide clear insights into land distribution, utilization, and future potential for development and conservation.

Visualizations
This project features a series of Tableau visualizations that dissect different aspects of land potential trends through the last few years:

Heatmap (Visualization 1): Shows the density of land use across different areas.
Charts (Visualization 2, 3, and 4): Provide detailed breakdowns of land quality, usage patterns, and potential for various types of development.

Data Source
The data used in these visualizations are sourced from https://www.realtor.com/research/data/.
